- simple game to relax. You play as a small fish, eating smaller fish,
growing and trying to get the best score. Obviously, you can't eat bigger fish,
because they eat you. So keep out of them and try to have fun! <br>
- made in Java with LibGDX (see <a class="classic_link" href="/pages/aboutJava.html">Java</a>)
