title: About Java

	<p>
	Java is an object-oriented programming language, that runs on 
	<a class="classic_link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine" target ="_blank"> Java Virtual Machine</a>. 
	That should make java applications run on any platform that supports JVM (in theory). <br>
	Practically it doesn't work just like that, but you can be almost sure that desktop version will work 
	on all the basic desktop systems (Windows, Linux, Mac) without issues. <br>
	<br>
	Still, you need to download JVM (if you haven't already) for running Java applications. 
	Check the latest version or download it <a class="classic_link" href="http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp" target="_blank"> here </a>.
	<br>
	If you are interested in programming in Java, you need also Java Development Kit(JDK), probably with some developer environment 
	(see <a class="classic_link" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/newtojava/learn-141096.html" target="_blank">here</a>). 
	</p>

By the way, here is an example of HelloWorld program in Java (with or without highlithing, who knows?): <br>	
{% highlight java %}
public class HelloWorldClass {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}
